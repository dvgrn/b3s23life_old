These files were copied, with a script name change but no other alterations, from Arie Paap's repository

https://github.com/apaap/b3s23life/tree/4G_const/three-glider-collisions/synthesise-constellation

which was branched from

https://github.com/dvgrn/b3s23life/tree/master/three-glider-collisions

which came from a script by Goldtiger997.  The link to the original is in the Python script.

This script is an improvement on the three-glider-collisions script in several ways.

It reports two- and three-glider collisions first, if those exist, the .n four-glider collisions.

It displays results in a rectangle instead of a single, often very long, horizontal line.

See for example results for a search on b2o$o2bo$b2o5$2o$2o! .

The subset of 4G collisions included in the database is very far from being an exhaustive enumeration.
