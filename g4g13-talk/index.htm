<title>LifeViewer Animations from G4G13</title>
</head><body>
<h1>LifeViewer Animations from "Self-Constructions in Conway's Life" talk</h1>
<p>Below is a set of nine LifeViewer animations, mostly constructed for a talk given at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5_D5QQxvWKXNXWDEKFNTG1vLS4lr03mp">Gathering for Gardner 13</a> in Atlanta, Georgia on April 2018.  The talk was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeUPTpeFamM&t=0s&list=PL5_D5QQxvWKXNXWDEKFNTG1vLS4lr03mp&index=56">Self-Construction in Conway's Life</a>.  This is a work in progress -- many of the animations could stand to be polished up further.</p>
<li><a href="lifeviewer1.htm">Animation 1: Topic Stack</a></li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer2.htm">Animation 2: construction arm example</a>.  Von Neumann replicator by William R. Buckley, 2007.</li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer3.htm">Animation 3: Intro to Life technology</a>.  High-bandwidth telegraph by Jean-Francois Handfield, Feb 2017.</li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer4.htm">Animation 4: construction arm in Conway's Life</a> Prototype universal construction arm by Paul Chapman, 2004. Gemini spaceship by Andrew J. Wade, 2010.</li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer5.htm">Animation 5: Variations on Life construction arms</a> -- Gemini (2010), DOpSearch (2011), spiral growth (2014), Demonoid (2015)</li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer6.htm">Animation 6: Glider Constructions Old and New</a>. Known recipes for c/2 spaceships, plus a cameo appearance by <a href="http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Sir_Robin">Sir Robin</a>, a knightship discovered shortly before the conference.</li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer7.htm">Animation 7: Slow salvo construction of p456 oscillator</a>. There wasn't time to show this in the talk.  This is an extended unidirectional glider construction compiled by Adam P. Goucher's <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/slmake">slmake</a>.</li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer8.htm">Animation 8: Four Snark Orientations</a> -- an earlier set of complex unidirectional syntheses, assembled for use in slmake.</li>
<li><a href="lifeviewer9.htm">Animation 9: Sir Robin "synthesis"</a>.  Constructed on April Fools' Day 2018.  Included here only because Sir Robin's cameo appearance was in a "Glider Constructions" animation.  A true glider synthesis of Sir Robin isn't likely to be available any time soon.</li>
